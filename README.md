# lane-detection-opencv

### About
Advanced OpenCV for lane detection and curvature in video.

### Data

* Camera calibration chessboard images are in `camera-cal`. Use to compute camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients.

* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.


### Code / Pipeline

`code.ipynb` (Jupyter notebook) implements the following pipeline:

* Camera calibration
* Distortion correction
* Transforms and Theresholding: Line detection through gradient threshodling along x and y axes, Color thresholding (S channel in HLS space to detect 'saturated' lane lines, V channel in HSV space to eliminate shadows.) 
* Perspective Transform using a trapezoidal region of interest
* Finding centers
	* Discrete horizontal slices
	* Convolution along x in each slice, to find points of highest pixel concentration (=lane centers)
	* Fit lines to centers found at each slice
* Find curvature and offset from center
* Inverse perspective transform to draw on road


### Testing

* Use `test.mp4` to test. Sample output in `out.mp4`
